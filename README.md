# FyneGameboy
üïπÔ∏è `FyneGameboy` is a Gameboy emulator GUI based on the [GameBoy.Live](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live) project by HFO4.
With this project you can play your favourite GameBoy games on desktop, mobile and beyond.

## Installation

You can build the app using Go Version 1.12 or higher as shown below.
On Debian based systems, the packages `libasound2-dev` and `libgl1-mesa-dev` must be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/andydotxyz/fynegameboy.git
cd fynegameboy
go build main.go
```

## Usage

```
Usage of gbdotlive:
  -d    Use Debugger in GUI mode
  -f FPS
        Set the FPS (default 60)
  -h    This help
  -m    Turn on sound (default true)
```

### Running

Play a specified ROM file in GUI mode:

```bash
$ fynegameboy "Tetris.gb" 
```

Alternatively you can just run the application and play
[Dino's Offline Adventure](https://github.com/gingemonster/DinosOfflineAdventure).
Many thanks to [Brian Norman](https://github.com/gingemonster) for permission to embed the game.

### Mobile

This app also supports a touchscreen configuration for mobile devices.
To build for a mobile device you need to use the `fyne` tool's package function:

```bash
$ go get fyne.io/fyne/cmd/fyne
$ fyne package -os android -appID xyz.andy.fynegameboy
$ adb install fynegameboy
```
